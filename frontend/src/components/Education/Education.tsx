                        üëâIt has been an incredible 4-year journey full of learning, where every semester was a chapter of growth, fun, and unforgettable memories. From tackling challenging projects, practical labs, and plenty of exams to late-night study sessions (every engineer‚Äôs favorite!), I embraced every opportunity to grow technically and personally. <br></br><br></br>

                        üéìI shifted to SD Sr. Sec. School, Isharwal in 11th grade because I had chosen the non-medical stream, which was not available in my previous school. This stream was chosen partly by chance and partly based on advice from others, considering my high 10th-grade percentage. <br></br><br></br>

                        üíªMost of my 11th and 12th preparation was completed through online batches from the Physics Wallah platform, specifically the Accelerate batch. While the course itself focused on academics, observing how the platform functioned, including its app, website, payment system, and overall backend, sparked my curiosity and passion for technology. This experience motivated me to pursue a career as a software engineer.

                        üéìI completed my 10th grade, along with all my earlier schooling, from Janta High School, Kairu (Bhiwani), which was located near my hometown. Although it was a private English-medium school, being in a rural area it lacked many facilities and resources. <br></br><br></br>

                        üì±Until I passed 10th grade, I had never used the internet, only heard that it existed in smartphones. Surprisingly, I became the school topper in my 10th boards, which no one, including me, expected. I still remember failing Mathematics in the pre-boards and starting to work hard from that point. Even then, I never thought I would score so well in the final exams.
