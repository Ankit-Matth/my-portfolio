# My Portfolio

 I developed my portfolio using the MERN stack, incorporating TypeScript and React-Bootstrap for enhanced functionality and styling. Through this project, I gained a deep understanding of MongoDB for efficient data storage, Express for backend routing and API development, React.js for dynamic UI creation, Node.js for server-side execution, TypeScript for improved code quality, and React-Bootstrap for streamlined frontend design. This hands-on experience in full-stack web development has emphasized the importance of integrating different technologies to create robust and user-friendly applications.

## Quick Demo

## Technologies Used

1. HTML, CSS, TypeScript
2. MongoDB, Express, React.js, Node.js
3. Typescript Syntax Extension, React-Bootstrap

Building this project felt like going on a coding adventure where each line of code taught me something new. I mainly concentrated on TypeScript, which helped me understand things like managing different types of events and components in React. Overall, this project wasn't just about writing code; it was a practical learning experience that really helped me grow as a web developer.
